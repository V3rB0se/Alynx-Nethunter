* NXP PN81A Embedded Secure Element

PN81A is part of an NXP NFC controller and depends on
access to eSE power via the controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nxp,pn81a"
- reg: SPI chip select.
- spi-max-frequency: SPI maximum speed.
- nxp,nfcc: Name of the i2c device where an nq-nci device is mapped.
- nxp,clear-n: Optional GPIO for clearing a inbound application GPIO.

Examples:

&spi_bus {
	pn81a@0 {
		compatible = "nxp,pn81a";
		reg = <0>
		spi-max-frequency = <8000000>;
		nxp,nfcc = "8-0028";
		nxp,clear-n = <&tlmm 29 0x00>;
	};
};
