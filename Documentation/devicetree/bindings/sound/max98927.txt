max98927 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C.

Required properties:

  - compatible : "maxim,max98927"

  - maxim,vmon-slot-no : slot number used to send voltage information
                   or in inteleave mode this will be used as
                   interleave slot.
                   This property can be set to values from 0 to 15 for slot 0 to 15.
                   Default value is 0.

  - maxim,imon-slot-no : slot number used to send current information
                   This property can be set to values from 0 to 15 for slot 0 to 15.
                   Default value is 0.

  - maxim,interleave-mode : When using two MAX98927 in a system it is
                   possible to create ADC data that that will
                   overflow the frame size. Digital Audio Interleave
                   mode provides a means to output VMON and IMON data
                   from two devices on a single DOUT line when running
                   smaller frames sizes such as 32 BCLKS per LRCLK or
                   48 BCLKS per LRCLK.
                   This property can be set to values from 0 to 1 for off and on.
                   Default value is 0.

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C

Example:

codec: max98927@3a {
   compatible = "maxim,max98927";
   maxim,vmon-slot-no = <0>;
   maxim,imon-slot-no = <1>;
   maxim,interleave-mode = <0>;
   reg = <0x3a>;
};
