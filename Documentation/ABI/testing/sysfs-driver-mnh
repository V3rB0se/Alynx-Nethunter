Contact:	Trevor Bunker <trevorbunker@google.com>
Description:
		Reads to this file return the current MNH CPU frequency in MHz.
		Writes to this file will change the MNH CPU frequency. The only
		accepted values for inputs are "200", "400", "600", "800", and
		"950".

Description:
		Reads to this file return the current MNH IPU frequency in MHz.
		Writes to this file will change the MNH IPU frequency. The only
		accepted values for inputs are "100", "200", "300", "400", and
		"425".

Description:
		Reads to this file return the current MNH LPDDR Frequency Set
		Point (FSP).  Writes to this file will change the MNH LPDDR
		FSP. The only accepted values for inputs are "0" "1", "2", and
		"3".

Description:
		Reads to this file return the current IPU clock source setting.
		The valid values are: "0", for CPU_IPU PLL; and "1" for IPU
		PLL.

Description:
		Reads to this file return a boolean indicating if the MNH
		device is operating in sys200 mode. By writing a "1" to this
		file, you can force the MNH device to enter sys200 mode.
		However, the only way to leave sys200 mode is to set the CPU,
		IPU, or LPDDR frequencies with the sysfs files listed above.

Date:		November 2017
Contact:	Trevor Bunker <trevorbunker@google.com>
Description:
		Reads to this file return a boolean indicating if the IPU is
		clock gated. By writing a "0" or "1" to this file, you can
		either disable or enable, respectively, IPU clock gating.

What:		/sys/devices/virtual/misc/mnh_sm/mnh_clk/bypass_clock_gating
Date:		November 2017
Contact:	Trevor Bunker <trevorbunker@google.com>
Description:
		A small subset of peripherals can be clock gated during MNH
		bypass mode for power savings.  Reads to this file return a
		boolean indicating if this subset is clock gated. By writing a
		"0" or "1" to this file, you can either disable or enable,
		respectively, clock gating to this subset.
