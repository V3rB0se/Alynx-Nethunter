config OVERLAY_FS
	tristate "Overlay filesystem support"
	help
	  An overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an 'upper' filesystem
	  and a 'lower' filesystem.  When a name exists in both filesystems, the
	  object in the 'upper' filesystem is visible while the object in the
	  'lower' filesystem is either hidden or, in the case of directories,
	  merged with the 'upper' object.

config OVERLAY_FS_OVERRIDE_CREDS
	bool "Overlay filesystem override credentials"
	depends on OVERLAY_FS
	default y
	help
	  If set, all access to the upper, lower and work directories is the
	  recorded mounter's MAC and DAC credentials.  The incoming accesses
	  are checked against the caller's credentials.

	  If the principles of least privilege are applied, the mounter's
	  credentials might not overlap the credentials of the caller's when
	  accessing the overlayfs filesystem.  The mount option
	  "override_creds=off" drops the mounter's credential check, so that
	  all subsequent operations, after mount, on the filesystem will only
	  be the caller's credentials.  This option sets the default for the
	  module option override_creds, and thus the default for all mounts
	  that do not specify this option.
