config CNSS2
	tristate "CNSS2 Platform Driver for Wi-Fi Module"
	depends on !CNSS && PCI_MSM
	---help---
	  This module adds the support for Connectivity Subsystem (CNSS) used
	  for PCIe based Wi-Fi devices with QCA6174/QCA6290 chipsets.
	  This driver also adds support to integrate WLAN module to subsystem
	  restart framework.

config CNSS2_DEBUG
	bool "CNSS2 Platform Driver Debug Support"
	depends on CNSS2
	---help---
	  This option is to enable CNSS2 platform driver debug support which
	  primarily includes providing additional verbose logs for certain
	  features, enabling kernel panic for certain cases to aid the
	  debugging, and enabling any other debug mechanisms.

config CNSS_ASYNC
	bool "Enable/disable CNSS platform driver asynchronous probe"
	depends on CNSS2
	---help---
	  If enabled, CNSS platform driver would do asynchronous probe.
	  Using asynchronous probe will allow CNSS platform driver to
	  probe in parallel with other device drivers and will help to
	  reduce kernel boot time.

config BUS_AUTO_SUSPEND
	bool "Enable/Disable Runtime PM support for PCIe based WLAN Drivers"
	depends on CNSS2
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  Runtime Power Management is supported for PCIe based WLAN Drivers.
	  The features enable cld wlan driver to suspend pcie bus when APPS
	  is awake based on the driver inactivity with the Firmware.
	  The Feature uses runtime power management framework from kernel to
	  track bus access clients and to synchronize the driver activity
	  during system pm.
	  This config flag controls the feature per target based. The feature
	  requires CNSS driver support.
