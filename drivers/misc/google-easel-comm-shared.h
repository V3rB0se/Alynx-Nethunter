 * Each side of the link allocates a command channel buffer in physically
 * contiguous memory (such that any portions can be addressed in a single iATU
 * region or single-block DMA transfer).  These are sometimes called
 * "ringbuffers", but in the current implementation flow control is performed
 * at each wraparound, effectively implementing a FIFO.
 *
 * Each driver uses PCIe remote writes to its peer's buffer to send commands
 * to the peer, and local memory access in the kernel virtual address space to
 * read the commands sent from the peer.
 *
 * Multi-byte integers in driver-layer data structures are sent across the link
 * in native format, which is assumed to be little-endian; endian conversion
 * would be needed for big endian systems.  It is assumed structure packing
 * rules are compatible on both sides of the link.
