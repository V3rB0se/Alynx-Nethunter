	#Not Working
	Atheros Ar9271 (tplink wn722n v1) 	
	+ (NETHUNTER USB FUNCTIONS due to compile time error's)



#Why
	
 	The main goal was to achieve working wifi adapter capapble of monitor state. it took me 1 month to get it working. i read many guides but none of them worked. i thought maybe i should create a proper guide on how you can compile the kernel yourself. so, without wasting much of your precious time lets get started.

#Guide 

i assume you're already using a linux distro 
create a working directory let's say in the home directory 

Working DIrectory 

cd $HOME && mkdir kernel 

Clone the kernel

git clone https://github.com/v3rb0se/

(or)

Download the zip file (i'll go with this)

mv downloaded_kernel.zip $HOME/WORKING/kernel/ && unzip downloaded_kernel.zip && rm download_kernel.zip


Download the required toolchains 

in my case i use this toolchain


(working)
